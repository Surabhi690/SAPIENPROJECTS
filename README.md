YOLOv5 Webcam Object Detection
Project Overview
This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model on webcam video input. It detects faces (or other objects depending on the model) and displays bounding boxes around detected objects live.

The main code is in the Jupyter Notebook file: webcam_yolov5_detection.ipynb.
